# Builder's Bounty

This is a game Project with Godot 4.4 C#, which will be my first real game (beside school projects). 

I want to connect my favorite game mechanics into one Game:
- City Building (Trailmakers Pioneers)
- Exploration to unlock new Stuff in a research tree (Satisfactory)
- Automation (Satisfactory)
- Building to help Exploring (ScrapMechanic)

If I'm going to add a Story at somepoint:
- Start with Citybuliding like RPG -> Quests.
- Uncover a hidden something. (Enemies, Unstable world)
- Save the world // Normally it ends here. I want to try to go further.
- Rebuild the World
